# TO-Project
Some stupid and irrelevant project I wish to make in stupid and irrelevant way

# Project motivation
Meet expection for our univesity OOP classes 

# Emotional [@osdnk](https://github.com/osdnk)'s technologies motivation
Decided to use Object Pascal ([Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/) with [Lazurus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/))

You may cosider it as some sophisticated form of sadomasochism (sado- as I wish to implement 
this project with this old-fashioned language, maso- as I wish my college mate make it too), but that's not true.

Frakly speaking, I wish to pay homage and make deep obeisance for my first language I got acquitanted with :computer:. It was not 
only beginning with my programming adventure, but this language got me enchanted with making software which suppose to 
determine my current and future life. Consider that I was 12 when wrote the first line code in Lazarus and was 13 
when made the last one :baby:. Then I was not conscious about OOP and whole top-tier-big-world-scrum-agile-and-other-related-adjectives
programming world so this code was shitty as hell :ok_woman:. 
In fact today I'm learning this language from scratch as I forgot hardly everything :cry:.

# Installation and running
Simple follow [guides on this page](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/index.php) in order to set up environment.

If you wish to run... well... I didn't manage to do it properly in my OSX so
I click the green button on IDE and consider it as fairly enough for this project :smile:
