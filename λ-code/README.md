# lambda-TO-Project

# Why Haskell [@Pituuss](https://github.com/Pituuss)'s motivation
I' ve dicided to use haskell since as I looked at the "object pascal" solution
I felt bad really bad. It is not a bad solution but it is boring AF while
writting solution, which was suposed to fullfil object-oriented paradigm,
in functional language seemed far more intresting. 
Secondly I wanted to show that you don't really need object-oriented language to write object-oriented code.

# How To
First and for a most you need stack since it is stack project
then everything is as simple as 
```
stack build
stack exec lambda-objective-exe
```
